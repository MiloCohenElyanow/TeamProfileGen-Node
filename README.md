# TEAM PROFILE GENERATOR w/ NODE

## Description

  This application is exactly what the title says it is. It is a team profile generator, made around Node: Inquirer, & in depth testing around Node:Jest. This program when ran will prompt you with questions from inquirer to build your work team. Inquirer will ask you a series of questions to enter information about your team members, you can have as many as you like! Once your done adding your team members the HTML web page will be generated, and you can view that clean team profile you have always wanted!

## WHY

  This application has been incredibly good practice with writing OOP (Object Oriented Programming). For me there has been a massive learning curve with it, for everything included in OOP. Coming out the other side of this project I feel fairly comfortable with OOP and am ready to apply it in lots of scenarios. This leads to the second part of that thought which is writing tests for my applications with Jest. After exploring jest and the docs I can think of one hundred and one reasons why jest is usefull for almost any project in the future. as well as Jest in my opinion follows object oriented programming pretty closely. Finally writing a html page with inquirer features thrown into a template literal posed a massive challenge to me about a week ago, of course it ended up being a fairly simple solution, and I can say that now. But this project seemed to me to be a monster at the beginning and through decisive planning and previous hard work, this challenge ended up being a lot easier than I thought it was going to be!

## Installation

  If your not the reading type like me heres a quick video showing installation and feature usage [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HwUvK-iNqe8EGj1cLWtpkNBklpg2VE35/view?usp=sharing)
  Otherwise please read the instructions below, Im going to keep them LIGHT.

  - either pull down this repository from github [HERE](https://github.com/whotf1/TeamProfileGen-Node) or download the entire file from github [HERE](https://github.com/whotf1/TeamProfileGen-Node)

  - unzip/unpack this project and throw it into your favorite IDE or work with your favorite terminal, using your root of your computer where ever I or these instruction use any file path(/thisFile path OR ./someFilePathHere/orHere)

  - in your terminal please open "main" from this project contents in your chosen command line

  - type in the command line/ run {npm i}
  - type in the command line/ run {node test} to run and view tests from the tests folder
  - type in the command line/ run {node index.js} to view program in action

  - once you run the program and answer questions from jest, where the heck is your html file? IT IS IN PagesHtml FOLDER, IF YOU MAKE MULTIPLE FILES THEY WILL OVERWRITE EACH OTHER, if you want to make multiple and save multiple please manually move each individual html file to a different location before making a new one.

  - Sample: there is a sample html page in the pagesHtml folder if you want to see a mock up of what this website will look like.

## Usage

  do whatever you want with this project if you have questions feel free to contact me @ milocohenelyanow@gmail.com

## Tech Stack

    - NODE:inquirer
    - NODE:Jest
    - In depth OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
    - In depth Advanced file structuring

## Tests

  you can find the tests folder im sure in this project. Each test tests the different types of employees themselfs, and their unique aspects, aswell as tests the super object employee, these tests work by using a Node module called Jest, Jest allows for easy file and script testing by allowing you to run that file, object, function, whatever, and match a expected outcome against what actually happens when you use the specified thing.
